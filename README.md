# Conch: Coordinate podcasts and conference calls

Conch is a simple web application to help conference calls go more smoothly.
VoIP calls have so much lag. Conch reduces interruption wars 
using a simple raise-your-hand mechanism and the honor system.

Conch is like the conch shell in William Golding's novel, *Lord of the
Flies*:

<blockquote>
&ldquo;And another thing. We can&rsquo;t have everybody talking at once.
We&rsquo;ll have to have &rsquo;Hands up&rsquo; like at school.&rdquo;
<br/>
He held the conch before his face and glanced round the mouth.
<br/>
&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give him the conch.&rdquo;
<br/>
&ldquo;Conch?&rdquo;
<br/>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what this shell&rsquo;s called. I&rsquo;ll give the
conch to the next person to speak. He can hold it when he&rsquo;s
speaking&rdquo;
<br/>
&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;
<br/>
&ldquo;Look&mdash;&rdquo;
<br/>
&ldquo;And he won&rsquo;t be interrupted: Except by me.&rdquo;
</blockquote>
